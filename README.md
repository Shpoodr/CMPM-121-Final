# CMPM-121-Final

Devlog Entry - [11/14/2025]

## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Logan Marshall

Engine Lead: Jayson Boyanitch

Design Lead: Gabriel Groenwold

Testing Lead: Andrew Hernandez

## Tools and materials

Engine: Phaser3 framework, three.js, ammo.js, enable3d. We will be using Phaser3 as the main engine for our project but since that does not come with any automatic 3d/physics support We will be including three.js as well as ammo.js to the project for the added support. Phaser will be used for features handling the main game loop, scene management, asset loading, user input, and 2D UI elements.
three.js - https://threejs.org/ will be used for handling all the 3d rendering, models, lighting, and camera managment. ammo.js https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/ will be used for handling all of the 3d physics simulations such as, collision detection and rigid body dynamics. Luckly for us there is a plugin called enable3d that works as the "glue" between these tools which allows for all of these frameworks to talk to each other properly.

Language: Javascript, HTML, JSON

Tools: VS Code, Piskel, Aseprite, Blender, Figma, Photoshop

Generative AI: We want to use Gemini for referencing documentation of the different engines, and maybe Copilot for debugging.
